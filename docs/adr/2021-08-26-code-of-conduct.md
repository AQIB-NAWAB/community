# Expectations of community are clearly explained by a code of conduct

## Context and Problem Statement

To the best of my knowledge, JSON Schema has never formally had a Code of Conduct (CoC).

I personally recall a few instances where a CoC may have been useful.

We want to make people feel welcome, and so should have a formal CoC.

## Decision Drivers

* We have had a few instances where it would have been useful to have a CoC
* Assuming we continue to join the OpenJS Foundation, they would expect us to have a CoC
* Not having a CoC may make our community less welcoming

## Considered Options

* Contributor Covenant
* IETF BCP 54
* Roll our own

## Decision Outcome

We decided to use the Contributor Covenant in conjunction with IETF BCP 54.

The Contributor Covenant is well established and regarded as a brilliant de-factor Code of Conduct option for open source projects.

BCP 54 defines some specifics on how we should interact with each other which the Contributor Covenant does not.

For example: "We dispute ideas by using reasoned argument rather than through intimidation or personal attack."

Further, should we choose to pursue publication throught the IETF, we would remain compatible in a sense.
