# The process of deprecating a feature

Once the decision to deprecate a feature has been made through an ADR , below is a recommend set of actions:

1. **Determine if you need an exception process**. Some features may require extended migration periods to allow customers extended time to fully adopt a new solution.

2. **Craft the message & build the internal enablement document**. This document should include frequently asked questions, timelines, and any other relevant information.

3. **Share the message internally**. The best Slack channel for this announcement is #announcements. The announcement should communicate the timeline and the related ADR.

4. **Share with users at minimum 30-days in advance**. It is recommended to start with a broad social media announcement including a blog post. The blog post should contain:
  - Why weâ€™re deprecating the feature.
  - What is changing.
  - What do you need to do?.
  - When is this change comming into effect? The deprecation timeline.


5. **Remind users twice**. 7 days and 1 day before. This is good practice to ensure that users hear the message and are following any migration steps required. The announcement will be shared in social media and Slack #announcements.

6. **Execute the deprecation**.
