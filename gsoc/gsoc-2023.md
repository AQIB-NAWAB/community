# About GSoC

Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors. For more details, visit the official site of [GSoC Program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023) .

# About JSON Schema

[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)  is a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents - 60+ million weekly installs. It defines how a JSON should be structured, making it easy to ensure that a JSON is formatted correctly, and it is useful for automated testing and validating. In addition, JSON Schema provides clear human- and machine-readable documentation. 

JSON Schema is an incubating project of OpenJS Foundation and a welcoming, inclusive, and vibrant [Community](https://json-schema.slack.com).
