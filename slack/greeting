Hey {{Joiner}}, Welcome to the JSON Schema Slack Server!

Whatever reason you chose to join us, we want you to know, you're welcome!
We are in the process of formalising our Code of Conduct, but we already subscribe to the IETF CoC, BCP54/RFC7154: <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7154.html>.
Be nice, be kind, be respectful.

If you need help, or you're looking to get stuck in with the JSON Schema community, you're in the right place.

This server includes the specification authors, many implementers, and a large number of helpful individuals from the community.

If you're looking for an implementation of JSON Schema, you should check out the <https://json-schema.org/implementations.html|implementations page>.

If you're looking to learn the basics of JSON Schema, do check out our <https://json-schema.org/learn|learning resources>.

If you want to ask questions or discuss JSON Schema, the #general channel is the right place.
We also recommend you join the #announcements channel, which is low traffic.

Here are some of our other channels and why you might want to join them.

If you have any questions about our community, please feel free to ask in #general, or DM {{@relequestual}}.
