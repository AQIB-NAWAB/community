# Sponsors

JSON Schema uses [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/json-schema) and [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) to gather money. This money is used to cover project expenses in a transparent way ([See the OpenCollective documentation](https://opencollective.com/how-it-works)), and your donation will help to sustain and grow the Project.

Please go to our [OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/json-schema) or [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/json-schema-org) to become a backer or a sponsor.

## Benefits of being a backer

Backers donate $5 per month to the project, and get the following benefits:

## Benefits of being a bronze sponsor

Bronze sponsors donate $100 per month to the project, and get the following benefits:

## What will the project do with the money?

As you can read in [the OpenCollective documentation](https://docs.opencollective.com), the way your money will be used will be public and totally transparent.

Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.

Money will first be used to cover direct project costs:

- Infrastructure and hosting
- New feature development
- Legal protection

Then, money will be used for:

- Merchandising
- Mentoring and Contributing programs
